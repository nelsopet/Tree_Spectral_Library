## Tree Spectral Library (treespectra)

The purpose of treespectra code is to take ground or image-based tree
reflectance spectra, build a classifier or regression ,and apply that
model to an imaging spectrometer data cube (aka hyperspectral image).

1\) First, install dependencies /Scripts/install_dependencies.R 2) Then
source the package of lecospectR /Functions/lecospectR.R

The functions in lecospectR are divided into sections, all of which are
loaded by sourcing /Functions/lecospectR.R

    /Functions/dataframe_operations.R  
    /Functions/model_support.R 
    /Functions/pfts.R  
    /Functions/pipeline.R  
    /Functions/raster_operations.R 
    /Functions/spectral_operations.R   
    /Functions/training_utilities.R    
    /Functions/type_conversion.R   
    /Functions/utilities.R 
    /Functions/validation.R    

## How to run treespectra

1\) Our workflow assumes a list of tree species: NEED SPECIES TABLE.
This table is used for several steps, including aggregating validation
to the same taxonomic level as training data. 2) Build a spectral
library from a range of field scans collected with Tungsten halogen
illumination using a leaf clip or contact probe. These scripts delete
bad scans and standardize the associated information into a single
metadata format. Around 90 vegetation indices are also calculated and
the narrow band reflectance is resampled and smoothed to 5 nm bands.

    /Scripts/2_DataMunging.R
    /Scripts/2B_DataMunging_missing_spectra.R   
    /Scripts/3_Create_SpecLibPSR.R

The output of running these scripts are two spectral libraries, one of
reflectance and one of vegetation indices along with the metadata for
these reflectance measurements.

3\) Collect spectra from pixels in UAV-captured images of tree canopies
that are visible in imagery. Stem maps of known tree locations are
overlaid on UAV flight path extents to identify canopy sources of
spectra (1_MSGC_extent, 2_MSGC_get_trees). Reflectance spectra are
extracted from hand-digitized tree canopies provided as a shapefile to
the script (3_crop_image_canopy_ROI). Each canopy is associated with
three hand-digitized shapefiles: 1) full canopy, 2) illuminated-only
branches, and 3) shaded-only branches. Cropping each image by the shapefile creates a set of images with 326 bands from 400-1000nm covering only the tree canopies that were hand
digitized based on stem maps of known tree locations. Script
(4_Parse_ROI_canopy_spectra) adds metadata to each pixel by tree species and
outputs a spectral library in wide format. Scripts
(5_Clean_image_spectra) and (6_Preprocess_viz_image) clean and process
data to facilitate the visualization of reflectance data by species.

    /Scripts/2_Image_processing/Headwall/1_MSGC_extent.R                     
    /Scripts/2_Image_processing/Headwall/2_MSGC_get_trees.R
    /Scripts/2_Image_processing/Headwall/3_Crop_image_canopy_ROI.R
    /Scripts/2_Image_processing/Headwall/4_Parse_ROI_canopy_spectra.R             
    /Scripts/2_Image_processing/Headwall/5_Clean_image_spectra.R
    /Scripts/2_Image_processing/Headwall6_Preprocess_viz_image.R

After running these scripts, the outputs include the relectance for each
pixel from the canopies digitized from images.

    M:/MSGC...

After cleaning and pre-processing, the reflectance data can be
summarized and visualized in various ways. Below is a summary of the
median (purple) and interquartile ranges (75% dark grey & 95% light
grey) of reflectance for a number of forest tree species in Maine.
Median reflectance of fully-illuminated branches (orange) and
fully-shaded branches (blue) are also shown. Sample size in number of
pixels is displayed for each species CHANGE THIS TO SAMPLE SIZE IN
NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS BY SPECIES.

## Study Area and Data locations

The centers of all UAV flights are shown in the map in the first image
below. Flight extents are generated from
/Scripts/2_Image_processing/Headwall/1_MSGC_extent. These locations are
then collected and summarized using
/Scripts/2_Image_processing/Headwall/7_Visualize_spectra_locations,
which produces the flight locations plotted on the map in the first
image below. The second image below shows a screen capture of one
hyperspectral image (aka imaging spectrometer data cube). The third
image below shows a portion of the same data cube enlarged, with
hand-digitized shapefiles of tree canopies overlaid.

In this script, The test_paths are set to the output of Script
3_Crop_image_canopy_ROI.R, which are a set of images with 326 bands
from 400-1000nm covering only the tree canopies that were hand
digitized based on stem maps of known tree locations. The vector layers of each hand digitized tree canopy are set in the shape_paths. The
validation_path are the ground cover estimates by tree derived from
ground photos by a single expert observer.
